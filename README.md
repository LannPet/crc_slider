This app was created for a technical interview assignment. The main objective was to demonstrate my skills in Javascript, HTML and CSS without using any external JS libraries.

NOTE: THIS APP IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT; THEREFORE, BUGS AND ERRORS MAY BE PRESENT.

The app is used to display different expenses that the user can input them via expense input form. Expenses are shown on the right hand side. Each expense has its own color and name and a corresponding circular slider, 
that can be used to increase or decrese the expense value.

HOW TO USE:

INSERTING A NEW EXPENSE:

1. Click on the "+ New Expense" button located on the left-hand side. A form will appear.
2. Fill in the expense properties and select the list where you want the expense to be saved.
3. Press the "Add Expense" button to add the expense.

DELETING AN EXPENSE:

1. To delete an expense, click on the "x" button next to the expense you want to remove.
2. Once an expense is deleted, it cannot be restored.

CHANGING THE LIST:

1. To switch between lists, click on the list button and select the desired expense list. Note that only two lists are currently available.
