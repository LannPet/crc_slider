This app was created for a technical interview assignment. The main objective was to demonstrate my skills in Javascript, HTML and CSS without using any external JS libraries.

NOTE: THIS APP IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT; THEREFORE, BUGS AND ERRORS MAY BE PRESENT.

The app allows users to input and display various expenses through an expense input form. Expenses are displayed on the right-hand side of the interface. Each expense has a unique color and name, accompanied by a circular slider that can be used to adjust the expense value.

IMPORTANT: 
  - App does not use a database to save slider info. therefore, everything resets on reload,
  - Mobile view can display and store only 4 expenses on each list,
  - Mobile view works on displays such as: iphone xr, 12, 14 pro, S20 ultra, pixel 7,
  - Browser view tested on macbook pro 16 M3 and monitor 1920 x 1080.

HOW TO USE:
